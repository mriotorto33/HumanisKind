# Human Is Kind (HIK) SDK

Blockchain-anchored provenance for C2PA manifests. Sign assets locally, store manifests on IPFS, and anchor hashes to a smart contract for permanent verification.

## Architecture

```
Asset → C2PA Sign → Manifest JSON → SHA-256 Hash → IPFS Pin → Blockchain Anchor
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your PRIVATE_KEY, RPC_URL, PINATA_API_KEY, PINATA_SECRET_KEY
```

### 3. Compile Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### 4. Run Tests

```bash
npx hardhat test tests/test-blockchain-flow.ts
```
## 🧪 Test Without External Services (Mock Mode)

```typescript
const certificate = await signAndAnchor('./my-asset.jpg', {
  useMockIPFS: true,
  blockchain: {
    rpcUrl: 'http://localhost:8545',
    privateKey: 'your-test-key',
    contractAddress: 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS',
  },
  storage: {}, // required by TypeScript but unused in mock mode
});
```

## CLI Commands

### Deploy Locally (with running node)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start local Hardhat node
npx hardhat node

# Terminal 2: Deploy contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
```

### Deploy to Polygon Amoy (Testnet)

```bash
# Ensure .env has PRIVATE_KEY and optionally POLYGON_RPC_URL
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network amoy
```

### Deploy to Polygon Mainnet

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network polygon
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { signAndAnchor, verifyAsset } from "human-is-kind-sdk";

const certificate = await signAndAnchor("/path/to/asset.jpg", {
  blockchain: {
    rpcUrl: process.env.RPC_URL!,
    privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!,
    contractAddress: process.env.HIK_REGISTRY_ADDRESS!,
  },
  storage: {
    pinataApiKey: process.env.PINATA_API_KEY,
    pinataSecretKey: process.env.PINATA_SECRET_KEY,
    // Optional: increase timeout (ms) when pinning can be slow.
    timeoutMs: 120_000,
  },
});

console.log(certificate);
// { localPath, manifestHash, ipfsUrl, txHash }

const verification = await verifyAsset(
  { rpcUrl, contractAddress },
  certificate.manifestHash
);
```

## 🔎 See the Certificate Object (Example Script)

A small helper script is included to run the full flow and print the certificate to your console.

```bash
# Start a local node in one terminal:
#   npx hardhat node

# Run the helper (uses mock IPFS):
npx hardhat run scripts/show-certificate.ts --network localhost
```

## HIK Certificate

After signing and anchoring, you receive:

| Field        | Description                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `localPath` | Path to the signed asset             |
| `manifestHash` | SHA-256 hash of the manifest      |
| `ipfsUrl`   | IPFS URI (e.g. `ipfs://Qm...`)       |
| `txHash`    | Blockchain transaction hash          |
